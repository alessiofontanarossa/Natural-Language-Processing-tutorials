Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and AI agents.\\u202f\\n\\n\\nLangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI\\xa0(genAI) more accessible to enthusiasts and startups in the wake of its widespread popularity. Advancements in accessibility for agentic AI are currently enabling a revolution in automation.\\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even AI\\xa0agents capable of robotic process automation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntegrations with LLMs\\n\\n\\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of artificial intelligence products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        How does LangChain work?\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of\\xa0abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\\n\\n\\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\\n\\n\\nImporting language models\\n\\n\\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\\nMany open source models, like Meta AI’s LLaMa, Deepseek's Deepseek-LLM, IBM's Granite and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face. IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\\xa0allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\\n\\n\\nPrompt templates\\n\\n\\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\\n\\n\\nChains\\n\\n\\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\\nThe most basic chain is\\xa0LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define\\xa0chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call\\xa0chain_example.run(“input”).\\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\\n\\n\\nIndexes\\n\\n\\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\\n\\n\\nDocument loaders\\n\\n\\nLangChain offers\\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\\n\\n\\nVector databases\\n\\n\\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\\xa0vector databases\\xa0represent data points by converting them into\\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\\n\\n\\nText splitters\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTo increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces. LangChain’s\\xa0TextSplitters\\xa0split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval\\n\\n\\nOnce external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers\\xa0retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\\xa0its\\xa0retriever\\xa0modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of\\xa0Document’s as output.\\nWith LangChain, we can also build agentic RAG systems.\\xa0In traditional RAG applications, the LLM is provided with a vector database to reference when forming its responses. In contrast, agentic AI applications are not restricted to only data retrieval. Agenic RAG can also encompass tools for tasks such as solving mathematical calculations, writing emails, performing data analysis and more.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\n\\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of previous interactions (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n\\xa0most recent exchanges.\\n\\n\\nTools\\n\\n\\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\\nLangChain tools\\xa0are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide. Examples of prominent pre-built LangChain tools include:\\n\\nWolfram Alpha: provides access to powerful computational and data visualization functions, enabling sophisticated mathematical capabilities.\\nGoogle Search: provides access to Google Search, equipping applications and agents with real-time information.\\nOpenWeatherMap: fetches weather information.\\nWikipedia: provides efficient access to information from Wikipedia articles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustry newsletter\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latest AI trends, brought to you by experts\\n\\n\\n\\nGet curated insights on the most important—and intriguing—AI news.

Unlike a simple prompt-response interaction with just an LLM, an agent powered by LangChain can think, plan, execute a sequence of actions, learn and adapt.\\nLangChain provides a streamlined user experience with a ready-made, extensible framework for creating AI agents, so there’s no need to build new tool selection logic, reasoning loops (such as for ReAct agents), observation/action tracking or prompt orchestration and formatting.\\nThe specific LangChain packages, classes and methods vary depending on the AI platform you intend to use. Some key components of the WatsonxLLM class that allow for communication with watsonx.ai models using LangChain include:\\nlangchain_ibm: The package responsible for the LangChain IBM integration. It is necessary to install this package to use any of the following classes and methods.ibm_watsonx_ai: The library that allows connection to watsonx.ai services like IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud Pak for Data.APIClient: The main class of the ibm_watsonx_ai\\xa0library that manages the API service resources. The parameters include the API credentials and endpoint.WatsonxLLM: The wrapper for IBM watsonx.ai foundation models. This wrapper provides chain integration and is necessary to import. The parameters include the model ID, watsonx.ai API key, URL endpoint, project ID as well as any LLM parameters.ModelInference: The class that instantiates the model interface. The parameters include the model ID, watsonx.ai credentials, project ID, model parameters and more. Once instantiated, the model can then be passed into the class.invoke: The method that calls the model directly with a single prompt of string type.\\xa0generate:\\xa0The method that calls the model with multiple prompts of string type in a list.\\nAnother LangChain class for building AI agents with the integration of tool calling and chaining with\\xa0watsonx.ai models is ChatWatsonx. This class, which is leveraged in many of our tutorials, uses the bind_tools method to pass a list of tools to the LLM upon each iteration. These can include both custom and pre-built tools. To retrieve the AI agent response, the invoke method\\xa0can be used. Once the agent is invoked, the tool_calls attribute\\xa0of the response displays the name, arguments, id and type of each tool call made, if any.\\n\\n\\nLangGraph\\n\\n\\nLangGraph, created by LangChain,\\xa0is an open source AI agent framework that supports multi-agent orchestration and enables developers to build\\xa0agentic workflows\\xa0where different agents interact, specialize and collaborate.\\xa0\\nAt its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an\\xa0AI agent workflow.\\xa0Combined with the human-in-the-loop monitoring mechanism and a set of API and tool integrations, LangGraph provides users with a versatile platform for developing AI solutions and workflows including\\xa0chatbots, state graphs and\\xa0other agent-based systems.\\xa0\\nWith the langchain-mcp-adapters library, LangGraph agents can also use tools defined on model context protocol (MCP) servers. The mcp library allows users to build custom MCP servers as well. Essentially, MCP enables a secure connection between an AI system, such as an AI agent, and external tools. Thus, various LLMs can connect to the same tools and data sources given the standard MCP.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      AI Academy\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Why foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGo to episode\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        LangSmith\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nReleased in the fall of 2023, LangSmith aims to bridge the gap between the accessible prototyping capabilities that brought LangChain to prominence and building production-quality LLM applications.\\xa0\\nLangSmith provides tools to monitor, evaluate and debug applications, including the ability to automatically trace all model calls to spot errors and test performance under different model configurations.

Created by IBM and Red Hat, the InstructLab community project provides a cost-effective solution for improving the alignment of LLMs and opens the doors for those with minimal machine learning experience to contribute.Join the InstructLab community \\nWhat does InstructLab do?LLMs serve as the foundation for generative AI use cases, like chatbots and coding assistants. These LLMs can be proprietary (such as OpenAI’s GPT models and Anthropic’s Claude models) or offer varying degrees of openness around pretraining data and usage restrictions (such as Meta’s Llama models, Mistral AI’s Mistral models, and IBM’s Granite models).AI practitioners often need to adapt a pretrained LLM to suit a particular business purpose. But there are limits to the ways you can modify an LLM:Fine-tuning an LLM to understand a specific area of knowledge or skills typically involves forking an existing open model, then running expensive, resource-intensive training.There’s no way to incorporate improvements back to the upstream project, and thus no way for models to continuously improve from community contributions.LLM refinements have typically required large amounts of human-generated data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to get.InstructLab follows an approach that punches through those limitations. It can enhance an LLM using far less human-generated information and far fewer computing resources than are typically used to retrain a model. And it makes it possible for upstream contributions to continuously make the model better.InstructLab is named after and based on IBM Research’s work on Large-scale Alignment for chatBots, abbreviated as LAB. The LAB method is described in a\\xa02024 research paper by members of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and IBM Research.InstructLab is not model-specific. It can provide supplemental skills and knowledge fine-tuning to an LLM of your choice. This “tree of skills and knowledge” improves continuously from community contributions and can be applied to support regular builds of an enhanced LLM. InstructLab maintains an\\xa0enhanced version of IBM Granite. Two other lab-enhanced models released by IBM include\\xa0Labradorite, which is derived from Llama 2, and\\xa0Merlinite, which is derived from Mistral. The InstructLab project prioritizes fast iteration and intends to retrain models on a regular basis. Organizations can also use the InstructLab model alignment tools to train their own private LLMs with their own proprietary skills and knowledge.How to apply AI at the enterprise\\xa0 \\n\\nRed Hat resourcesKeep reading\\n\\n\\nHow does InstructLab work?The LAB method consists of 3 components:Taxonomy-driven data curation. Taxonomy is a set of diverse training data curated by humans as examples of new knowledge and skills for the model.Large-scale synthetic data generation. The model is then used to generate new examples based on the seed training data. Recognizing that synthetic data can vary in quality, the LAB method adds an automated step to refine the example answers, making sure they’re grounded and safe.Iterative, large-scale alignment tuning. Finally, the model is retrained based on the set of synthetic data. The LAB method includes 2 tuning phases: knowledge tuning, followed by skill tuning.The contributions of data from the community can lead to regular iterative builds of enhanced LLMs, each made better by the tree of skills generated from community contributions. \\nHow is InstructLab different from other methods of training an LLM?Let’s compare InstructLab to the other steps in creating and improving an LLM.PretrainingDuring pretraining, an LLM is trained to predict the next token using trillions of tokens of unlabeled data. This gets really expensive, sometimes requiring thousands of GPUs and months of time. Pretraining a highly capable LLM is only possible for organizations with significant resources.Alignment tuningAfter pretraining, LLMs undergo alignment tuning to make the model’s answers as accurate and useful as possible. The 1st step in alignment tuning is typically instruction tuning, in which a model is trained directly on specific tasks of interest. Next is preference tuning, which can include reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this step, humans test the model and rate its output, noting if the model’s answers are preferred or unpreferred. An RLHF process may include multiple rounds of feedback and refinement to optimize a model.Researchers have found that the amount of feedback at this alignment tuning stage can be much smaller than the initial set of training data―tens of thousands of human annotations, compared to the trillions of tokens of data required for pretraining―and still unlock latent capabilities of the model.InstructLabThe LAB method emerged from the idea that it should be possible to realize the benefits of model alignment from an even smaller set of human-generated data. An AI model can use a handful of human examples to generate a large amount of synthetic data―then refine that list for quality―and use that high-quality synthetic data set for further tuning and training. In contrast to instruction tuning, which typically need thousands of examples of human feedback, LAB can make a model significantly better using relatively few examples provided by humans.How is InstructLab different from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?The short answer is InstructLab and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solve different problems.RAG is a cost-efficient method for supplementing an LLM with domain-specific knowledge that wasn’t part of its pretraining. RAG makes it possible for a chatbot to accurately answer questions related to a specific field or business without retraining the model. Knowledge documents are stored in a vector database, then retrieved in chunks and sent to the model as part of user queries. This is helpful for anyone who wants to add proprietary data to an LLM without giving up control of their information, or who needs an LLM to access timely information.\\xa0This is in contrast to the InstructLab method, which sources end-user contributions to support regular builds of an enhanced version of an LLM. InstructLab helps add knowledge and unlock new skills of an LLM.It’s possible to \"supercharge\" a RAG process by using the RAG technique on an InstructLab-tuned model.Learn more about RAG\\xa0 \\nWhat are the components of the InstructLab project?InstructLab is composed of several projects.TaxonomyInstructLab is driven by taxonomies, which are largely created manually and with care. InstructLab contains a taxonomy tree that lets users create models tuned with human-provided data, which is then enhanced with synthetic data generation.Command-line interface (CLI)The InstructLab CLI lets contributors test their contributions using their laptop or workstation. Community members can use the InstructLab technique to generate a low-fidelity approximation of synthetic data generation and model-instruction tuning without access to specialized hardware.Model training infrastructureFinally, there’s the process of creating the enhanced LLMs. It takes GPU-intensive infrastructure to regularly retrain models based on new contributions from the community. IBM donates and maintains the infrastructure necessary to frequently retrain the InstructLab project’s enhanced models.Dig deeper into AI infrastructure \\nDiscover Red Hat Enterprise Linux AIWhen you’re ready to bring AI to the enterprise, Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® AI brings together the Granite family of open source-licensed LLMs, InstructLab model alignment tools, a bootable image of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, enterprise-grade technical support, and model intellectual property indemnification.Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform, certified on hundreds of clouds and with thousands of hardware and software vendors.

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'file-sample.docx'}, page_content='Demonstration of DOCX support in calibre\\n\\nThis document demonstrates the ability of the calibre DOCX Input plugin to convert the various typographic features in a Microsoft Word (2007 and newer) document. Convert this document to a modern ebook format, such as AZW3 for Kindles or EPUB for other ebook readers, to see it in action.\\n\\nThere is support for images, tables, lists, footnotes, endnotes, links, dropcaps and various types of text and paragraph level formatting.\\n\\nTo see the DOCX conversion in action, simply add this file to calibre using the “Add Books” button and then click “Convert”.  Set the output format in the top right corner of the conversion dialog to EPUB or AZW3 and click “OK”.\\n\\n\\n\\nText Formatting\\n\\nInline formatting\\n\\nHere, we demonstrate various types of inline text formatting and the use of embedded fonts.\\n\\nHere is some bold, italic, bold-italic, underlined and struck out  text. Then, we have a superscript and a subscript. Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text with a yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video.\\n\\nA paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis  followed by strong text and intense emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph — calibre can handle both with equal ease.\\n\\nFun with fonts\\n\\nThis document has embedded the Ubuntu font family. The body text is in the Ubuntu typeface, here is some text in the Ubuntu Mono typeface, notice how every letter has the same width, even i and m. Every embedded font will automatically be embedded in the output ebook during conversion. \\n\\nParagraph level formatting\\n\\nYou can do crazy things with paragraphs, if the urge strikes you. For instance this paragraph is right aligned and has a right border. It has also been given a light gray background.\\n\\nFor the lovers of poetry amongst you, paragraphs with hanging indents, like this often come in handy. You can use hanging indents to ensure that a line of poetry retains its individual identity as a line even when the screen is  too narrow to display it as a single line. Not only does this paragraph have a hanging indent, it is also has an extra top margin, setting it apart from the preceding paragraph.\\n\\nTables\\n\\nITEM\\n\\nNEEDED\\n\\nBooks\\n\\n1\\n\\nPens\\n\\n3\\n\\nPencils\\n\\n2\\n\\nHighlighter\\n\\n2 colors\\n\\nScissors\\n\\n1 pair\\n\\nTables in Word can vary from the extremely simple to the extremely complex. calibre tries to do its best when converting tables. While you may run into trouble with the occasional table, the vast majority of common cases should be converted very well, as demonstrated in this section. Note that for optimum results, when creating tables in Word, you should set their widths using percentages, rather than absolute units.  To the left of this paragraph is a floating two column table with a nice green border and header row.\\n\\nNow let’s look at a fancier table—one with alternating row colors and partial borders. This table is stretched out to take 100% of the available width.\\n\\nCity or Town\\n\\nPoint A\\n\\nPoint B\\n\\nPoint C\\n\\nPoint D\\n\\nPoint E\\n\\nPoint A\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint B\\n\\n87\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint C\\n\\n64\\n\\n56\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint D\\n\\n37\\n\\n32\\n\\n91\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint E\\n\\n93\\n\\n35\\n\\n54\\n\\n43\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, we see a table with special formatting in various locations.

Additionally, the inner table has some of its cells merged. The table is displayed horizontally centered.\\n\\nOne\\n\\nThree\\n\\nTwo\\n\\n\\n\\nFour\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the left is a table inside a table, with some cells merged.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe end with a fancy calendar, note how much of the original formatting is preserved. Note that this table will only display correctly on relatively wide screens. In general, very wide tables or tables whose cells have fixed width requirements don’t fare well in ebooks.\\n\\nDecember 2007\\n\\nSun\\n\\n\\n\\nMon\\n\\n\\n\\nTue\\n\\n\\n\\nWed\\n\\n\\n\\nThu\\n\\n\\n\\nFri\\n\\n\\n\\nSat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStructural Elements\\n\\nMiscellaneous structural elements you can add to your document, like footnotes, endnotes, dropcaps and the like. \\n\\nFootnotes & Endnotes\\n\\nFootnotes and endnotes are automatically recognized and both are converted to endnotes, with backlinks for maximum ease of use in ebook devices.\\n\\nDropcaps\\n\\nD\\n\\nrop caps are used to emphasize the leading paragraph at the start of a section. In Word it is possible to specify how many lines of text a drop-cap should use. Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible when converting.  Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a “D” dropcap set to occupy three lines of text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly.\\n\\nLinks\\n\\nTwo kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those that refer to locations inside the document itself. Both are supported by calibre. For example, here is a link pointing to the calibre download page. Then we have a link that points back to the section on paragraph level formatting in this document.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThere are two approaches that calibre takes when generating a Table of Contents. The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. Provided that the Table of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.\\n\\nIf no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is automatically generated from the headings in the document. A heading is identified as something that has the Heading 1 or Heading 2, etc. style applied to it. These headings are turned into a Table of Contents with Heading 1 being the topmost level, Heading 2 the second level and so on.\\n\\n You can see the Table of Contents created by calibre by clicking the Table of Contents button in whatever viewer you are using to view the converted ebook. \\n\\n\\tDemonstration of DOCX support in calibre\\t1\\n\\n\\tText Formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tInline formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tFun with fonts\\t2\\n\\n\\tParagraph level formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tTables\\t3\\n\\n\\tStructural Elements\\t5\\n\\n\\tFootnotes & Endnotes\\t5\\n\\n\\tDropcaps\\t5\\n\\n\\tLinks\\t5\\n\\n\\tTable of Contents\\t5\\n\\n\\tImages\\t7\\n\\n\\tLists\\t8\\n\\n\\tBulleted List\\t8\\n\\n\\tNumbered List\\t8\\n\\n\\tMulti-level Lists\\t8\\n\\n\\tContinued Lists\\t8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImages\\n\\nImages can be of three main types. Inline images are images that are part of the normal text flow, like this image of a green dot . Inline images do not cause breaks in the text and are usually small in size. The next category of image is a floating image, one that “floats “ on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph.\\n\\nThe final type of image is a “block” image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own and has no text on either side. Below is a centered green dot.\\n\\nCentered images like this are useful for large pictures that should be a focus of attention. \\n\\nGenerally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word document to an ebook. That is because in Word, image positioning is specified in absolute units from the page boundaries.  There is no analogous technology in ebooks, so the conversion will usually end up placing the image either centered or floating close to the point in the text where it was inserted, not necessarily where it appears on the page in Word.\\n\\nLists\\n\\nAll types of lists are supported by the conversion, with the exception of lists that use fancy bullets, these get converted to regular bullets.\\n\\nBulleted List\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nNumbered List\\n\\nOne, with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nMulti-level Lists\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nThree\\n\\nFour with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly.\\n\\nFive\\n\\nSix\\n\\nA Multi-level list with bullets:\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nThis bullet uses an image as the bullet item\\n\\nFour\\n\\nFive\\n\\nContinued Lists\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nAn interruption in our regularly scheduled listing, for this essential and very relevant public service announcement.\\n\\nWe now resume our normal programming\\n\\nFour')]"

Consequently, you can perform operations such as semantic search, where you identify pieces of text that are most similar within the vector space.\n",

The database not only stores the data (and this is not a simple step, as the encoded data are in very high-dimensions), but also retrieve them using a similarity search (as in usual RAG, without the decoder for the moment). However, the retrieving part is low-lwvwl, in the sense that it is not integrated with a complete NLP flux. Instead, we use an integrated **(vector store)-based retriever**\n",

This avoids redundancy and ensures comprehensive coverage of query;\n",
    "2. **Multi-query retriever**: similar to 1. but <span style=\"background-color: yellow\"> requires an inference LLM</span> to generate a richer set of document. This is used if the embedding of 1. is poor and do not capture the semantic of the query;\n",
    "3. **Self-query retriever**: used if the document to be retrieved has also metadata. It works by converting the query into:\n",
    "    - a string to look up semantically;\n",

       "'Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \\n\\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \\n\\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \\n\\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.   \\n\\nThey keep moving.   \\n\\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \\n\\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \\n\\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \\n\\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. \\n\\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. \\n\\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. \\n\\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.   \\n\\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. \\n\\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. \\n\\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  \\n\\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.   \\n\\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. \\n\\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. \\n\\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. \\n\\nTogether with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. \\n\\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.  \\n\\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.   \\n\\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.  \\n\\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. \\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.  \\n\\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. \\n\\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. \\n\\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. \\n\\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. \\n\\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. \\n\\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.  \\n\\nLet me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.  \\n\\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.  \\n\\nFor that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. \\n\\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.  \\n\\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.  \\n\\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos.  But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. \\n\\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay. \\n\\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. \\n\\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly. \\n\\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.  \\n\\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. \\n\\nThis is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you. \\n\\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. \\n\\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. \\n\\nThe pandemic has been punishing. \\n\\nAnd so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. \\n\\nI understand. \\n\\nI remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. \\n\\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.  \\n\\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. \\n\\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis. \\n\\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.  \\n\\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance. \\n\\nAnd as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room. \\n\\nAnd unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind. \\n\\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. \\n\\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \\nthan ever before in the history of America. \\n\\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.  \\n\\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \\n\\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \\n\\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. \\n\\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \\nand the middle out, not from the top down.  \\n\\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \\n\\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. \\n\\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. \\n\\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that. \\n\\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history. \\n\\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. \\n\\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. \\n\\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade. \\n\\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.  \\n\\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. \\n\\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. \\n\\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. \\n\\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. \\n\\n4,000 projects have already been announced. \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. \\n\\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. \\n\\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. \\n\\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century \\nto make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. \\n\\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. \\n\\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. \\n\\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. \\n\\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. \\n\\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it. \\n\\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. \\n\\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \\n\\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”. \\n\\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \\n\\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. \\n\\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. \\n\\nBut that’s just the beginning. \\n\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \\n$20 billion to $100 billion. \\n\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \\n\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \\n\\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.  \\n\\nAnd we will really take off. \\n\\nAnd Intel is not alone. \\n\\nThere’s something happening in America. \\n\\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story. \\n\\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.   \\n\\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. \\n\\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \\n\\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \\n\\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \\n\\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. \\n\\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” \\n\\nIt’s time. \\n\\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \\n\\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \\n\\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \\n\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \\n\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \\n\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \\n\\nLook at cars. \\n\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \\n\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \\n\\nSo—we have a choice. \\n\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \\n\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \\n\\nLower your costs, not your wages. \\n\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \\n\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \\n\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \\n\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \\n\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \\n\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \\n\\nI call it building a better America. \\n\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \\n\\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \\n\\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \\n\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \\n\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \\n\\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \\n\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \\n\\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \\n\\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \\n\\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \\n\\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \\n\\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.  \\n\\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. \\n\\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \\n\\nAll of these will lower costs. \\n\\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.  \\n\\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.  \\n\\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \\n\\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \\n\\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. \\n\\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. \\n\\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.  \\n\\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. \\n\\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.  \\n\\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. \\n\\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. \\n\\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \\n\\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \\n\\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \\n\\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \\n\\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \\n\\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \\n\\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \\n\\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \\n\\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \\n\\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \\n\\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \\n\\nThat ends on my watch. \\n\\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \\n\\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \\n\\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \\n\\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \\n\\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \\n\\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \\n\\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \\n\\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \\n\\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \\n\\nBut I also know this. \\n\\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \\n\\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \\n\\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \\n\\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \\n\\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \\n\\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \\n\\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \\n\\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \\n\\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \\n\\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \\n\\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \\n\\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \\n\\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \\n\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \\n\\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \\n\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \\n\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \\n\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \\n\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \\n\\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \\n\\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \\n\\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \\n\\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \\n\\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \\n\\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\n\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \\n\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time. \\n\\nI know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \\n\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \\n\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \\n\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \\n\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \\n\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \\n\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \\n\\nWe cannot let this happen. \\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \\n\\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \\n\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \\n\\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \\n\\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \\n\\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \\n\\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \\n\\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \\n\\nLet’s get it done once and for all. \\n\\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \\n\\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \\n\\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \\n\\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \\n\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \\n\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \\n\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \\n\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. \\n\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \\n\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \\n\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \\n\\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \\n\\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. \\n\\nThird, support our veterans. \\n\\nVeterans are the best of us. \\n\\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \\n\\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \\n\\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. \\n\\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. \\n\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. \\n\\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness. \\n\\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. \\n\\nI know. \\n\\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. \\n\\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. \\n\\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can. \\n\\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. \\n\\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.  \\n\\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. \\n\\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields. \\n\\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter. \\n\\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body. \\n\\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. \\n\\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. \\n\\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. \\n\\nTonight, Danielle—we are. \\n\\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. \\n\\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. \\n\\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it. \\n\\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. \\n\\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease. \\n\\nLast month, I announced our plan to supercharge  \\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. \\n\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.  \\n\\nMore support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.  \\n\\nWe will meet the test. \\n\\nTo protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. \\n\\nWe will save democracy. \\n\\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life. \\n\\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp. \\n\\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity. \\n\\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity. \\n\\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities. \\n\\nSo on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union. \\n\\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong. \\n\\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago. \\n\\nAnd we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. \\n\\nNow is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. \\n\\nAnd we will, as one people. \\n\\nOne America. \\n\\nThe United States of America. \\n\\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.'"

If you have a large number of classes, you can use the `num_top_classes parameter` to control the number of classes that are outputted. For instance, if you have 1000 classes, setting `Label(num_top_classes = 3)` would output just the three classes with the highest predicted probabilities instead of the predicted probabilities for all classes."
